Use a combinatorial argument to show that the sequence $\{D_n\}$, where $D_n$
denotes the number of derangements of $n$ objects, satisfies the recurrence
relation $$D_n=(n-1)(D_{n-1}+D_{n-2})$$ where $n\ge2$.\parend
\emph{Hint}\/: Note that there are $n-1$ choices for the first element $k$ of
the derangement. Consider separately the derangements that start with $k$ that
do and do not have $1$ in the $k^{\rm th}$ position.\\[12pt]
