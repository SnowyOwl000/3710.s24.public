\item Show that if $p$ is a prime, the positive integers less than $p$, except
$1$ and $p-1$, can be split into $(p-3)/2$ pairs of integers such that each pair
consists of integers that are inverses of each other.\\
\emph{Hint}\/: Use the result of exercise 17.
\item From part (a) conclude that $(p-1)!\equiv-1\pmod p$ whenever $p$ is
prime. This result is known as {\bf Wilson's theorem}.
\item What can we conclude if $n$ is a positive integer such that $(n-1)!
\not\equiv-1\pmod n$?
